# BLOG-FR
this project is just a test carried out in the classroom. we "played" with the front-end and the back-end to create a small web page that loaded from the database-->MySQL.
some information about the posts created by us to have data in json.
Blog-fr is the part of front-end. so if you want the back end part go to ./python-flask-restapi
